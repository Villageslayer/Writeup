# Challenge: 
As hinted at in the [[Introduction]] this is very very Compute intensive so to add a Target to this, all of this should Run either on a SBC or Thinclient/MicroPC platform, which ishould not be hard to do in of itself. The real Challenge becomes Spoofing The input to legit hardware. 



# Target:

learn a new programming Language and go through "integration Hell"

# Motivation:

With Anticheat Getting More and More intrusive to the point that some Games (**coughs in Valorant** ) Require Anticheat Measures at Ring 0 aka The very Kernel level therefore becoming Intrusive rootkit Malware running 24/7.  
This leads to massive Security and Privacy concerns since Vanguard has been Known to Take Screenshots outside of the game and send more than those to government owned   Servers in China.

So The Only way Left is to Go beyond Software and utilize the only thing left, the Hardware Level, so the Only Vector of Detection Left is the input spoofing.
